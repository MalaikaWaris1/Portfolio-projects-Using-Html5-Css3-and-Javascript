        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>Hi, my name is
          Adeeba!</h2>
        <p>And Pinch of Yum is my little corner of the internet!

          I'm the voice, author, and creator behind Pinch of Yum. What started as a casual hobby over 14 years
          ago in 2010 while I was working as a fourth grade teacher has now grown into a full-blown business
          (!!) that reaches millions of people with fun recipes each month, with content that has been
          featured on The Kitchn, CNN, Refinery29, Brit + Co, POPSUGAR, Huffington Post, The Everymom,
          PureWow, and more.

          I live in Saint Paul, MN with my husband Bjork and our dog Sage. My favorite things in life are a
          big plate of pad Thai, sunny days, and going to the dog park.</p>
        <h3>I Love Food!</h3>
        <p>
          In this space, I am always sharing fresh, flavorful, (mostly) healthy recipes that I love to make and eat in
          my real, actual, every day life. If I wouldnâ€™t eat it in real life, I wonâ€™t put in on the blog. My goal is to
          inspire you with food that is both approachable AND exciting, whether youâ€™re cooking for yourself, your
          family, your roommates, or your friends. I want you to be so excited about these recipes that you eagerly
          await 5pm when you can go home from work and start cooking.

          On a related note, I absolutely LOVE seeing the food that youâ€™re making. It will make my day if you tag
          @pinchofyum in your Instagram photos and stories! We love to shout out our favorites on Fridays with our
          Reader Awards on Instagram Stories.</p>
